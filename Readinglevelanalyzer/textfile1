US forces hunting elusive al Qaeda and Taliban fighters in eastern 
Afghanistan have come under mortar and rocket fire but suffered no 
casualties, a US military official said on Tuesday.
US Army Colonel Roger King said a special operations patrol in Konarha 
Province near the border of Pakistan came under mortar fire on Monday 
evening.
The troops returned fire with their own mortars and called in close air 
support. Two FA-18 Hornet attack jets dropped two Mark 82 bombs on the 
suspected mortar site.
"We are awaiting battle damage assessment by friendly forces," King told 
reporters at Bagram air base, the staging post for US-led international 
forces in Afghanistan.
